                    Scorpions are a German rock band formed in 1965 in Hanover by Rudolf Schenker. They're one of the most successful rock bands to come out of Continental Europe.Initially, they played a style that was influenced by British blues-rock, but as their career progressed, they evolved into a more melodic hard rock sound, gaining significant commercial success.

However, it was their album "Love at First Sting" (1984) that propelled them to global stardom, thanks to hits like "Rock You Like a Hurricane" and "Still Loving You."

                    Scorpions' music is characterized by catchy melodies, powerful guitar riffs, and Meine's distinctive vocal style. They've sold over 110 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists in history.
